# OSS Index dependency vulnerability audit (oysteR / Sonatype).
#
# `oysteR::audit_description()` resolves the installed DESCRIPTION and audits
# pagerankr's hard dependencies against the Sonatype OSS Index. It is a network
# test that requires OSS Index credentials (OSSINDEX_USER / OSSINDEX_TOKEN):
# the API rejects unauthenticated requests with HTTP 401, so the test is
# guarded to skip wherever those preconditions are absent (CRAN, offline,
# missing credentials, oysteR not installed). The dedicated security-audit.yml
# workflow supplies the credentials as repository secrets so the audit actually
# runs there (and drives the README badge); in every other context (local runs,
# the verify/full-check/rhub suites) it skips cleanly rather than failing.
#
# Scope: hard dependencies only -- `Depends` + `Imports`, never `Suggests`.
#
# `oysteR::expect_secure()` audits `Depends` + `Imports` + `Suggests`, and
# `Suggests` drags in the recursive dependency trees of the dev tooling --
# including oysteR's own, which reaches `curl` through httr. So the gate was
# failing on a vulnerability in the auditor rather than in anything a user of
# pagerankr installs.
#
# Measured 2026-09-10, same machine and credentials:
#
#     fields = Depends+Imports              23 packages audited, clean
#     fields = Depends+Imports+Suggests    126 packages audited, reports curl
#
# `curl` is absent from pagerankr's hard dependency tree entirely. The two
# flagged advisories -- CVE-2026-18924 (CWE-416 use-after-free, CVSS 9.1) and
# CVE-2026-3783 (CWE-522 insufficiently protected credentials, CVSS 6.9) --
# both name libcurl ranges that include CRAN's current `curl` 8.0.0, so no
# available version clears them and no local action could make the old scope
# pass. PAGE-aqnbdkov carries the full measurement.
#
# A package's security posture is what it makes users install, so the audit
# calls `audit_description()` directly with the narrower `fields`.
# `expect_secure()` sets a CRAN mirror internally and `audit_description()`
# does not, hence the explicit `repos` option.
